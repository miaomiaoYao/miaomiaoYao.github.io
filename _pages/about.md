Welcome to Rong Wei's homepage!

This is Rong Wei,a junior student from the University of Science and Technology of China

Currently, my major is statistics

My research intersets: causality analysis, statistic learning, data privacy...

Besides, the idea of applying statistic analysis methods to help build models for computational neuroscience, intersected with machine learning really interests me. And I think using AI method to help doctors to analyze medical images is meaningful!!
